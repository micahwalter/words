title: point in time.

"We all want to remember where we were, what we were doing, what it felt like. There's something really visceral about that--like a feeling where the importance, or significance, comes from the knowledge that you were in fact there, at that moment, like lots of other people were."

"I think of big moments in history like when the Challenger blew up. I was sitting on the floor in class, watching it on a large TV, strapped to a cart. The teacher eventually just shut the TV off and started talking about something else. I can remember it so vividly. I'm weirdly proud of that memory, like I was there, so that makes me interesting, but so were so many other people."

"Today. I will remember today, and us, and what happened today. I promise."
